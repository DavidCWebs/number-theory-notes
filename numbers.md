Numbers
=======

The use of numbers starts with counting. Count objects: one, two, etc. Basic operations like addition and multiplication.

Are the inverses possible? Can we reverse addition and multiplication?

Subtraction
-----------
Subtraction is an inverse to addition. Subtraction is not always possible if integers are only positive - you can't subtract three objects from a group of two objects and obtain a positive integer. The solution is __negative__ numbers and zero. Though these ideas are simple, they are deep concepts that took humanity a long time to invent.

Division
--------
If you multiply 3 by 4, the result 12 can be divided by either 3 or 4 and the result is a positive integer.

Like subtraction, division is not always possible. Fractions may be sufficient - so dividing 12 by 5 can be expressed as 12/5 or an integer with a decimal fraction - rational numbers.

For some applications, an integer answer is neccessary. This leads to number theory.

Number Theory
-------------
Number Theory studies integers and operations on them.

Basic number theory has natural applications, but advanced number theory had at first no natural applications.

The computer era changed this.

Number theory is vital for modern cryptography.

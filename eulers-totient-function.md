Euler's Totient Function
========================

* Important for RSA encryption
* Easy to compute if factorization of _n_ is known
* If the factors of _n_ are not known, there is no known fast algorithm for computation
* There are no known fast algorithms for the factorization of integers
* Easy to compute with some private information, but no known way to compute without - a key property for cryptography

::: tip Definition
Euler's totient function Ã˜(n) counts integers between 0 and _n_ - 1 which are coprime with _n_.
